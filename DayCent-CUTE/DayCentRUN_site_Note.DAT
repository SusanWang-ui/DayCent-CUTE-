Note: 
1.Dalhart;
2. Mead2: 1) no detailed fertilization date and planting/harvesting date for each year
       2) clay %? used 31% (not in reference paper/s)
	   3) deeper tillage since 1992 (after "initial" measurement in 1984, and then 1992, 98, 2002)
	  # The previous crop residue from corn or grain sorghum was shredded in late fall, followed by tillage that consisted of
		disking once or twice 10–15 cm deep in the spring just before planting from 1983 through 1991. 
	  # After 1992, a disk with larger diameter disks was used for tillage, resulting in an effective depth of tillage of 15–20 cm deep.
3. Wooster: 1) initial 30cm SOC is estimated using linear interpolation
            2) no CFG for wheat (not included)
4. ORpegn: 1) where to find the other study period?
5. Five Points
6. Fort Valley
7. Brookings SD

updated weatehr for year1980
8. Hoytville: 1).wth from 1980; year 1980 is from DAYMET 
                 experiment started in 1963
              2) some pooled observations

9. South Charleston OH: 1) .wth   1971 initial measurement
			  Continuous corn should have been fertilized. could not find the application rates, 
			  but it stated that it had used N and P; used values from Wooster, OH

10. Narrabri Australia: weatehr from 2001 with missing data too
		1) FieldC1: simulation starts in 1993; 
11.		1) Field6: simulation starts in 1998; 


4. Mead: Book pp197: initiated in 1975 at the University of Nebraska ARDC.
Arlington: 1) 30cm to be updated
